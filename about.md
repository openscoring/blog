Good, insightful discussions about the applicability of [Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML)] (http://www.dmg.org/) to addressing common predictive analytics problems are surprisingly hard to come by.

This blog aims to disseminate knowledge that has been acquired during the development of [JPMML-Model] (https://github.com/jpmml/jpmml-model) and [JPMML-Evaluator] (https://github.com/jpmml/jpmml-evaluator) Java libraries.
